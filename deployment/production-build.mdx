Learn how to build Biovity for production and understand the build process.

## Build process overview

Biovity uses Next.js 16 with Turbopack for fast builds. The production build compiles your application, optimizes assets, and prepares everything for deployment.

## Build commands

### Production build

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
bun build
```

This command runs `next build --turbopack`, which:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Bundles and optimizes all pages and components
- Generates static pages where possible
- Optimizes images and assets
- Creates production-ready output in `.next` directory

### Start production server

After building, start the production server locally:

```bash
bun start
```

This runs `next start` and serves your built application on port 3000.

### Development server

For development with hot reload:

```bash
bun dev
```

This starts the Next.js development server with Turbopack for fast refresh.

## Pre-build checks

Before building for production, run these checks to ensure code quality:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type check">
    Verify TypeScript types are correct:
    
    ```bash
    bun typecheck
    ```
    
    This runs `tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors without generating output files.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Lint and format">
    Check and fix code style issues with Biome:
    
    ```bash
    bun check
    ```
    
    This runs `biome check --write .` to lint and auto-fix formatting issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the build">
    Build the production bundle:
    
    ```bash
    bun build
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build configuration

Biovity's build is configured with the following optimizations:

### Turbopack

The project uses Turbopack (`--turbopack` flag) for faster builds. Turbopack is Next.js's Rust-based bundler that provides:
- Faster incremental builds
- Improved development experience
- Better memory efficiency

### Code quality

Biome is configured for strict code quality:
- Line width: 100 characters
- Semicolons: as needed
- Strict linting rules with recommended and stylistic rules enabled
- TypeScript strict mode with `noExplicitAny` as error

### Dependencies

Trusted dependencies that can run install scripts:
- `sharp` - Image optimization
- `unrs-resolver` - Module resolution

## Build output

After a successful build, you'll find:

- `.next/` - Production build output (do not commit to version control)
- `.next/static/` - Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `.next/server/` - Server-side code
- `.next/cache/` - Build cache for faster subsequent builds

<Warning>
  Never commit the `.next` directory to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.
</Warning>

## Build errors

If your build fails, check for:

### Type errors

```bash
bun typecheck
```

Fix any TypeScript errors before building.

### Linting errors

```bash
bun lint
```

Biome will report code quality issues that need to be resolved.

### Environment variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set. See the [environment variables](/deployment/environment-variables) guide for details.

### Missing dependencies

Install all dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## CI/CD integration

For automated builds in CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run checks
bun typecheck
bun check

# Build for production
bun build
```

<Info>
  Most deployment platforms like Vercel automatically detect and run the build command. You typically don't need to configure this manually.

## Performance optimization

The build process includes several automatic optimizations:

- **Code splitting** - Splits code into smaller chunks for faster loading
- **Tree shaking** - Removes unused code from the bundle
- **Minification** - Compresses JavaScript and CSS
- **Image optimization** - Automatically optimizes images with `sharp`
- **Static generation** - Pre-renders pages at build time where possible

## Build time expectations

Typical build times:
- Small projects: 30-60 seconds
- Medium projects: 1-2 minutes
- Large projects: 2-5 minutes

Factors affecting build time:
- Number of pages and components
- Size and number of dependencies
- Static generation vs server-side rendering
- Image optimization workload
