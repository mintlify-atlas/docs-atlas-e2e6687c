description: User registration and login flows for employees and organizations on Biovity platform
---

Biovity provides separate authentication flows for employees (professionals, students, researchers) and organizations (companies, institutions, laboratories). The platform uses Better Auth for secure email/password authentication with 7-day sessions.

## Account types

Biovity supports two distinct user types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Individual users" icon="user">
    For professionals, researchers, and students seeking job opportunities in the scientific sector
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organizations" icon="building">
    For companies, institutions, and laboratories looking to hire scientific talent
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Registration flow

New users can create an account by selecting their account type and completing the registration form.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select account type">
    Navigate to the registration page and choose between "Individual User" or "Organization" account type. Each type provides different platform features and dashboard access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete registration form">
    Fill in your details including name, email, password, and profession (for individual users) or company information (for organizations).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email verification">
    Verify your email address to activate your account and access the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access dashboard">
    Once verified, you'll be automatically redirected to your personalized dashboard based on your account type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Login flow

Returning users can access their accounts through a unified login page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to login page">
    Visit the login page where you'll see options for both individual users and organizations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your account type">
    Choose whether you're logging in as an individual user or organization. This determines which dashboard you'll access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter credentials">
    Provide your registered email and password to authenticate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your dashboard">
    After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to your role-specific dashboard:
    - Individual users → Employee dashboard (`/dashboard/employee`)
    - Organizations → Organization dashboard (`/dashboard/organization`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session management

Biovity uses secure session management to keep users logged in:

- **Session duration**: 7 days by default
- **Auto-redirect**: Already logged-in users are automatically redirected to their dashboard
- **Rate limiting**: 10 authentication requests per minute per IP address to prevent abuse
- **Secure cookies**: Session state is persisted securely across browser sessions

## Account security

Your account security is protected through:

- Email/password authentication
- Secure session tokens
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- User type validation (employee vs organization)
- Protected dashboard routes based on account type

## Custom user fields

Biovity tracks additional user information beyond standard authentication:

- `type`: Employee ("persona") or Organization ("organización")
- `profession`: User's scientific specialization
- `avatar`: Profile picture
- `isActive`: Account status
- `organizationId`: For linking users to their organization
