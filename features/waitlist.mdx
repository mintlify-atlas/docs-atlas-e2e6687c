description: Pre-launch registration for early access to Biovity platform
---

Biovity offers a waitlist feature for collecting early interest from professionals and organizations before full platform launch or for access to new features.

## Waitlist page

The waitlist is accessible at `/lista-espera` (Spanish for "waiting list") and allows users to register their interest in the platform.

<Info>
The waitlist feature is designed for pre-launch campaigns or limited beta access to new features.
</Info>

## Registration types

The waitlist supports two types of registrations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Professionals" icon="user">
    Scientists, researchers, and students looking for job opportunities
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Organizations" icon="building">
    Companies and institutions seeking to hire scientific talent
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Waitlist form

Users provide the following information when joining the waitlist:

### For professionals

- **Full name**: First and last name
- **Email address**: For communication and platform access
- **Role type**: "professional" designation
- **Scientific field**: Area of expertise (biotechnology, biochemistry, chemistry, etc.)
- **Current position**: Student, researcher, or professional level
- **Location**: City/region in Chile

### For organizations

- **Company name**: Organization name
- **Email address**: Business email for communication
- **Role type**: "empresa" (company) designation  
- **Industry sector**: Type of scientific organization
- **Company size**: Number of employees
- **Hiring needs**: Expected number of positions to fill

## Technical implementation

### Database schema

Waitlist registrations are stored in PostgreSQL:

```sql title="lib/db/migrations/001_waitlist.sql"
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS waitlist (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  field TEXT,
  company TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE waitlist 
  ADD CONSTRAINT waitlist_email_key UNIQUE (email);
```

### API endpoint

Waitlist registrations are processed through the `/api/waitlist` endpoint:

**POST /api/waitlist**

Accepts registration data and stores it in the database.

```typescript title="Request body"
{
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: "professional" | "empresa";
  field?: string;
  company?: string;
}
```

**Validation:**

The request is validated using Zod schemas defined in `lib/validations/waitlist.ts`:

```typescript
import { waitlistSchema } from '@/lib/validations'

// Validates email format, required fields, and role type
const result = waitlistSchema.parse(formData)
```

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data?: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
  }
}
```

## Validation rules

<ParamField path="email" type="string" required>
  Must be a valid email format. Unique constraint prevents duplicate registrations.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  Full name, minimum 2 characters
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="role" type="enum" required>
  Either "professional" or "empresa". Determines follow-up communication and onboarding flow.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="field" type="string">
  Scientific field of interest (for professionals). Examples: "Biotecnología", "Bioquímica", "Química"
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="company" type="string">
  Company name (for organizations). Required when role is "empresa"
</ParamField>

## Email notifications

## Admin management

The admin dashboard (`/dashboard/admin`) includes waitlist management:

## Priority access

## Marketing integration

The waitlist integrates with marketing tools for growth:

- **Email campaigns**: Automated nurture sequences via email service provider
- **Analytics tracking**: Conversion tracking for marketing attribution
- **A/B testing**: Test different messaging and calls-to-action
- **Referral program**: Waitlist members can invite colleagues

<Tip>
Waitlist campaigns are particularly effective for building anticipation before new feature launches or market expansions.
</Tip>

## Best practices

When running a waitlist campaign:

1. **Clear value proposition**: Explain what users gain by joining
2. **Expected timeline**: Provide rough estimate of when access will be granted
3. **Regular updates**: Keep waitlist engaged with progress updates
4. **Segmented communication**: Different messaging for professionals vs. organizations
5. **Gradual rollout**: Invite users in batches to manage onboarding capacity

## Privacy and data handling

<Warning>
Waitlist data is handled according to Chilean data protection laws and Biovity's privacy policy. Users can request deletion of their data at any time before platform access is granted.
</Warning>

Email addresses are used solely for:
- Waitlist confirmation
