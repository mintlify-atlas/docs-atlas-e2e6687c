Biovity requires Node.js 20+ or Bun to run. Follow these steps to install the project dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Biovity, ensure you have one of the following installed:

- **Node.js 20+** with npm
- **Bun** (recommended for faster installation)

<Note>
Biovity uses Bun for development, but you can use npm if you prefer. All examples include both options.

## Install dependencies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    First, clone the Biovity repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd biovity
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install packages">
    Install all project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash bun
      bun install
      ```

      ```bash npm
      npm install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    This will install all dependencies listed in `package.json`, including:

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Verify that the installation was successful by checking the installed packages:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash bun
      bun --version
      ```

      ```bash npm
      npm list --depth=0
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>
